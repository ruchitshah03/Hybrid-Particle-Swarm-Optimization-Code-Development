This file shows the method to use the code:

1.	Copy all the files in a folder
2.	Make sure the file MeasuredResponse.dat is there while running case P5.
3.	All the files namely P1.m, P2.m, P3.m, P4.m, P5.m  are the function file and no need to open that.
4. 	The files namely run_P1.m, run_P2.m, run_P3.m, run_P4.m, run_P5.m are files that are needed to run for the 	respective case.
5.	Follow the instruction in the MATLAB file for each run mentioned there and change the variable, penalty function 		condition and iteration as stated and required to get the desired result.
6.	There is also P5_test.m file that shows the dynamic response plot for the best result that is obtained for static 	and dynamic cases.
7. 	The file PSO.m is the general file that shows the basic algorithm.
